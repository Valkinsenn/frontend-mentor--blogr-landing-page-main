## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Custom CSS through SASS
- Mobile-first design
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

For starters, on top of what I know about layouts, I learned one very valuable lesson: if you're fighting with Grid, you're using it wrong. Also, I learned how to have dropdown menus on responsive navbars.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks | The "Checkbox Hack"](https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/) - Even if I did something different for my solution, this was essentially a fantastic starting point for understanding how to make this happen with as little JavaScript as possible.
- [CSS Tricks | A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Pretty much par for the course, but this is instrumental for anyone looking to use CSS Grid.
- [David Walsh | Pure CSS Slide Up and Down](https://davidwalsh.name/css-slide) - Pretty much how I was able to make the rollup animations on the navbar work.
- [Stack Overflow | Transitions effects on scrollbars](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46304690) - This helped me figure out how to have custom scrollbars that fade in and out whenever a user hovers over the web page.
